Jay: I worked on spell words and delete word from graph functions as well as
 print. I also made the gradescript.

Question:
We used a queue, map, and a vector in our implementation. The queue was used to 
in the BFS to check if a node was visited or not. The map was used to hold the
IDs of each die in our input. Then we used vectors to store each character in the 
strings. The average time complexity should be O(|V||E|^2) based on our usage
of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm.
